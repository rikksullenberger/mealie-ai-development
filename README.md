# Mealie AI

A fork of [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) with enhanced AI capabilities for automatic recipe image generation.

## About This Fork

This is a modified version of the excellent **Mealie** recipe management application, created by the talented team at [mealie-recipes](https://github.com/mealie-recipes). 

### Acknowledgments

**Huge thanks to the original Mealie developers** for creating such an outstanding open-source recipe manager! Their clean architecture, beautiful UI, and thoughtful design made it possible to add this AI image generation feature seamlessly. This fork builds upon their incredible work and wouldn't exist without their dedication to the project.

### What's Different?

This fork adds **comprehensive AI-powered recipe management** features:

#### Latest Updates
- **v3.5.13**: Recipe Remix feature - Create variations of existing recipes with AI modifications, plus bug fixes for 404 redirects
- **v3.5.8**: Enhanced fusion capabilities for recipe remixing
- **v3.5.5**: Fixed "ChunkLoadError" issues by implementing auto-reload on frontend and improved cache control headers

#### Core AI Features
- **Recipe Remix/Variants**: Transform existing recipes with AI - make them healthier, change cuisines, adjust servings, or create fusion variations
- **AI Recipe Generation**: Generate complete recipes from simple descriptions using GPT-4o or GPT-3.5-turbo
- **AI Image Generation**: Create professional food photography images using DALL-E 3
- **Batch Operations**: Generate missing images for multiple recipes in one click
- **Smart Auto-tagging**: Automatically tag recipes based on their content
- **Custom Image Prompts**: Provide specific instructions for AI-generated recipe images
- **High-Quality Images**: Images are generated at 1024x1024 resolution with professional food photography style
- **Optional Features**: Image generation is disabled by default to avoid unexpected API costs

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- **OpenAI API Key** (required for AI features)
  - Without an API key, the AI recipe generation and image features will not be visible in the UI
  - Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Installation

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rikksullenber/mealie-ai.git
   cd mealie-ai
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key:**
   
   Edit `docker/docker-compose.yml` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:9091`

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for AI features:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | - | Yes (for AI features) |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | OpenAI model to use | `gpt-3.5-turbo` | No |
| `OPENAI_ENABLE_IMAGE_SERVICES` | Enable image generation | `true` | No |

**Important:** 
- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, the AI recipe generation menu option will be hidden from the UI.
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` is used by default for maximum compatibility with JSON mode features.
- You can also use `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4` (note: `gpt-4` does not support JSON mode).

## Usage

### Creating a Recipe with AI

1. Navigate to **Create** → **Generate with AI**
2. Enter your recipe description (e.g., "Creamy Italian Carbonara")
3. **Optional**: Check the "Generate Image" checkbox to create an AI-generated image
4. **Optional**: Check the "Auto-Tag" checkbox to automatically tag the recipe
5. Click **Generate**
6. The recipe will be created with all requested AI enhancements

### Recipe Remix (Create Variations)

**New in v3.5.13!** Transform existing recipes with AI:

1. Open any recipe
2. Click the **context menu** (three dots) in the toolbar
3. Select **Remix Recipe**
4. Choose a remix type:
   - **Healthier Version**: Reduce calories, fat, or sodium
   - **Different Cuisine**: Transform to another cuisine style
   - **Adjust Servings**: Scale ingredients up or down
   - **Fusion Recipe**: Combine with another cuisine
   - **Custom Instructions**: Provide specific modification instructions
5. Click **Remix** to generate the new recipe variant
6. The new recipe will be created with modifications and saved separately

### Regenerating Recipe Images

You can regenerate AI images for any recipe:

1. Open a recipe in edit mode
2. Click the **Regenerate Image** button near the image upload area
3. **Optional**: Provide a custom image prompt for specific styling
4. A new AI-generated image will be created and saved

### Cost Considerations

- **Recipe Generation**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (standard OpenAI pricing, ~$0.50-1.50 per million tokens)
- **Image Generation**: Uses DALL-E 3 (~$0.04-0.08 per image depending on quality settings)
- Image generation is **optional** and disabled by default to prevent unexpected charges

## Deployment to Remote Server

This repository includes scripts to deploy the AI-enabled Mealie to a remote server using Docker Hub.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Hub account
- Remote server with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- OpenAI API key

### Quick Deployment

   Edit `docker-compose.deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

2. **Update deployment script:**
   
   Edit `deploy-to-remote.py` with your server credentials:
   ```python
   hostname = "your-server-ip"
   username = "your-username"
   password = "your-password"
   ```

3. **Run deployment:**
   ```bash
